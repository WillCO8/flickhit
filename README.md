### 💡 Problem Statement  
In the age of digital overload, our photos often become lifeless thumbnails—stripped of the sound, feeling, and cultural atmosphere that surrounded them.  
People scroll through pictures, but rarely reconnect with the full emotional context of the moment.  
There’s no soundtrack. No era. Just pixels.

---

### 💡 Solution  
FlickHit is a web app that brings still images back to life.  
Upload a photo, and FlickHit reads the original date from its metadata.  
Then, it instantly links you to the **#1 Billboard Hot 100 song from that specific week**, reconnecting you to the music and mood of that time.

> It’s like time-travel through memory.  
> You don’t just look at a picture—you **hear** it.

### 🔊 What is “FlickHit”?  
It’s not just an app—it’s a verb, a ritual, a powerful emotional shortcut.

When you see a picture and want to unlock its musical memory, you simply say:  
**FlickHit** (pronounced like "flick it" or "flick hit").

It’s both the action of revealing the #1 song from that moment, and the joyful declaration of reliving it.

> “We saw that picture of us at our wedding and immediately, we just said: 'FlickHit!'”  
> “We were scrolling through pics and saw my graduation photo and said 'FlickHit'.”  
> “That moment when you find a forgotten memory and all you can think is, 'FlickHit!'”

FlickHit turns scrolling into **storytelling**.
