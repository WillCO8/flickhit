# üé∂ FlickHit: Cultural Playback App  
**‚ÄúMatch the date of your Flick to its #1 Hit‚Äù**

---

### üí° Problem Statement  
In the age of digital overload, our photos often become lifeless thumbnails‚Äîstripped of the sound, feeling, and cultural atmosphere that surrounded them.  
People flip through old pictures, but rarely do they reconnect emotionally with the full context of the moment.  
There‚Äôs no soundtrack. No era. Just pixels.

---

### üí° Solution  
FlickHit is a web app that brings still images back to life.  
Users upload a photo, and FlickHit reads the original date from its metadata.  
Then, it instantly links you to the **#1 Billboard Hot 100 song from that specific week**, reconnecting you to the music and mood of that time.

> It‚Äôs like time-travel through memory.  
> You don‚Äôt just look at a picture‚Äîyou **hear** it.

### üîä What is ‚ÄúFlickHit‚Äù?  
It‚Äôs not just an app‚Äîit‚Äôs a verb or a powerful statement.

When you see a picture and want to unlock its musical memory, you simply say:  
**FlickHit** (pronounced like "flick it" or "flick hit").  

It‚Äôs both the action of revealing the #1 song from that moment, and the immediate, memorable declaration of wanting to experience that connection.

> ‚ÄúWe saw that picture of us at our wedding and immediately, we just said: 'FlickHit!'‚Äù  
> ‚ÄúWe were scrolling through pics and saw my graduation pictures and said 'FlickHit'.‚Äù  
> ‚ÄúThat moment when you find a forgotten memory and all you can think is, 'FlickHit!'‚Äù

FlickHit turns scrolling into **storytelling**.
